# Swifternships
Swifternships was built at WildHacks 2023, Northwestern University’s largest hackathon. It won third place overall, as well as the most creative .tech domain prize.

It was developed by Andrew Pulver, Justin Dong, Ryan Newkirk, and Steve Ewald.
## Inspiration
We were inspired by our past experiences. It is difficult to find experiential learning opportunities outside of the classroom to apply and further develop skills taught in our coursework. As a result, it was difficult for us to find our first internships because employers view internship experience as the top deciding factor between otherwise equal candidates. Hence, without prior professional experience, we were at a distinct disadvantage when we first went through the recruitment process.

Additionally, through our experiences from talking to startups and local businesses, they struggle to recruit college students, despite their relative proximity. This can prevent them from keeping pace with their business goals because they don’t have enough people on their team.

Our identification of the problems facing college students, startups, and local businesses led us to create Swifternships.
## What It Does
Swifternships is the quick microinternships platform for college students. Our microinternships are short-term, unpaid internship opportunities that provide students with meaningful professional experiences. We simultaneously enable startups and local businesses to recruit college talent, enabling them to scale and grow.

On the student side, students first go through an onboarding process to input information on their background. Afterward, they gain access to the job listings on the platform, enabling them to quickly apply to microinternship opportunities in 2 minutes. They also have the options to edit their profile and view their previously submitted applications.

On the business side, employers also go through an onboarding process, similar to students. They can then post microinternship opportunities to college students and manage applications to each job listing they create.
## How We Built It
We built Swifternships using a React.js and Tailwind CSS frontend and a Google Cloud backend. The product was mainly developed using Typescript, with additional support from HTML, CSS, and Javascript. React Router was employed for smooth navigation, while SweetAlert2 was used for modal elements.

Apart from Google Cloud, we incorporated several APIs to enhance the platform's functionality. These included the Firebase API for access to its real-time database, the Twilio API for live notification delivery to our users, and the Sendinblue API for email notifications.
## Challenges We Ran Into
This challenge may be somewhat niche, but one of our most significant challenges was a bug in one of our GitHub branches that led to a divergent branch each time one of us made a merge request. Our initial solution was to “hack” around it by copying and pasting our code to "manually merge" it. However, we understood this approach was unsustainable (and bad practice), so we spent hours debugging it before we eventually resolved it.
## Accomplishments That We’re Proud Of
We are excited that we have developed a fully-functional MVP of our platform. Both college students and businesses have access to an entire suite of tools to connect with each other.
## What We Learned
We learned a lot from each other during WildHacks 2023. We taught each other about different web development tools and tricks, such as using the SweetAlert2 API to more effectively implement modal elements.

Additionally, we developed our skills in various frameworks and APIs that we were less familiar with, including Tailwind CSS and Firebase Realtime Database.
## What’s Next
We have launched Swifternships! Our product is live at www.swifternships.tech.

Our initial launch is for Northwestern University college students. We have already partnered with 12 businesses that have posted 9 real and exciting microinternship opportunities on the platform. 

In the third quarter of 2023, we intend to expand to other universities in the Midwest before widening our outreach in the fourth quarter to all universities across the United States.
